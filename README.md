# This thing, in a nutshell.

So, you've decided to buy a car (Linux Distro), it's rusty and it's not made for daily use (Ex. EyeVisionOS) but you still like it.

One day, you decide:

```
— Hey, I want to put a radio in this thing! (Program) —
- Famous last words before disaster.
```

So you go to the internet and search the radio and buy it. (Manually download the program, which is unusual, but stick with me!)

When it arrives though, you realize something: You don't got the tools to put it in! (DPKG, APT ect.)

You are sad now, but hope is not lost! You decide to buy a set of tools (Get-Pak) and you finally put the radio in, it's janky, but you did a great job!

# Downloading

Downloading is easy, you just have to make sure you have the dependencies:
This program requires `wget`, `curl` and other basic stuff that you surely have.

Next, type this command in:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCOS-Apps/get-pak/refs/heads/master/getpm
```

And done! You have yourself the program. It defaults to the Debian repository, feel free to edit it and make changes.
