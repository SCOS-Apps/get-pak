# This thing, in a nutshell.

So, you've decided to buy a car (Linux Distro), it's rusty and it's not made for daily use (Ex. EyeVisionOS) but you still like it. One day, you decide:
— Hey, I want to put a radio in this thing! (Program) —
So you go to the internet and search the radio and buy it. (Manually download the program, which is unusual, but stick with me!)
When it arrives though, you realize something: You don't got the tools to put it in! (DPKG, APT ect.)
You are sad now, but hope is not lost! You decide to buy a set of tools (Get-Pak) and you finally put the radio in, it's janky, but you did a great job!
